    introduction2: ` 一.项目介绍
    HASHLAND是融合了多元价值资产的新型NFT资产合成平台，HASHLAND的首款合成资产融合了动漫IP和算力资源、通过比特币算力挖矿的保值收益以及gamefi的主动收益P2E。对NFT进行多种价值捕捉，为用户提供多重收益保障。

    HASHLAND现已接入200P比特币算力，每张NFT卡牌锚定1T满存算力，首批发行量为6W张NFT，60P算力，始终保有一半以上冗余，当有机器出现故障时随时可以将补上。用户无论是在市场挂单交易，还是参与游戏时，都可享受算力挖矿带来的被动收益。于此同时，NFT产出20%的BTC将流入DAO池，用于采购新的机器以实现永续的目的，即便没有新的资金流入，用户持有NFT锚定的算力也会越来越多，这对于早期参与的用户是巨大的红利。

    HASHLAND团队自研多款链游，其中包括3D即时动作ARPG、沙盒、MOBA、FPS等多种类型，无论是趣味性是游戏的丰富度都将刷新GAMEFI赛道以往记录，HASHLAND将在12月份上线1款3D即时动作ARPG游戏，其中包含PVP、PVE、GVG、GVE等模式，不同的模式奖励也不同，玩家可以通过参与游戏，获取装备、道具从而赚取平台币HC，获得不菲的收入。丰富的游戏体系以及完备的奖励模型，极有可能定义下一代GameFi赛道标准。

    二.HASHLAND优势
    1、NFT有价值资产支撑（满存、永续、保值，自有合规矿场算力超额支撑，一半以上冗余保障满算力释放收益）。
    2、有丰富的游戏场景支撑（3D即时动作ARPG、沙盒、MOBA、FPS等多种类型游戏场景、种类多、收益高、品质高）。
    3、FREE TO EARN，每个玩家注册即送2个英雄可参与游戏对战赚取收益。
    4、赛季制公平性，赛季结束游戏内英雄等级，成长属性等数据清零，保留装备等上链数据。可以让每个赛季用户都从同一起点开始竞争，不会出现长期霸服等缺点。

    三.卡牌介绍
    HashLand发售的第一批卡牌总量6W张，通过币安NFT市场、合作渠道进行发售，首批卡牌锚定比特币的永续算力。每张NFT均有2个参数，左边的是平台币HC挖矿系数，右边的是比特币BTC挖矿系数。
    单张NFT的比特币收益=BTC挖矿系数/全网BTC挖矿系数之和
    同理单张NFT的HC收益=HC挖矿系数/全网HC挖矿系数之和
    NFT有5个等级，1级最低，只可挖BTC，从2级开始可以同时产出BTC和平台币HC。不同级别的NFT在gamefi场景中也对应更高的属性。
    卡牌合成：4张同级卡消耗一定量的HC可升级为高级卡牌，升级后的卡牌在BTC、HC的挖矿系数上也会有所加成。具体合成消耗加成参数见下表。
    合成技巧：四张同样角色的卡牌合成加成会最强，四张完全不同角色的卡牌合成加成会最弱。

    卡槽
    初始赠送两个卡槽，后续卡槽需消耗HC开启，消耗HC数量依次为4，16，64 游戏中会赠送初始两名角色，玩家最低需要凑齐3位英雄方可开始游戏，即最低需要准备1张NFT，每开启一个卡槽网站中可增加一个卡牌质押位，同时游戏中可多上阵一名角色

    卡牌收益计算
    收益计算公式：
    个人APR=(每日HC产出价值+每日BTC产出价值）/（卡牌价值+个人合成卡牌消耗HC价值）*100%*365

    四.HashWarfare介绍
    Hash Warfare 是 HashLand 元宇宙中引入的第一个 3D ARPG即时战斗游戏，用户可以在其中收集、交易、挖矿、日常任务并最终通过游戏赚取收益，打造将增强元宇宙游戏未来的工具。HashWarfare游戏有多种对战模式选项，PvE探险模式、PvP玩家对决和GvG公会对战模式等。同时，HashLand平台通过调配 GameFi 生态拥有的资产，最大化资产效用，并与资产所有人分享资产的利润。其 Beta 测试将于 12 月 15 日开始。

    哈希战争游戏玩法：
    1.卡片可以进行升阶，4个同等级的NFT可以通过消耗HC组合到更高的阶位。每张卡都有不同的计算能力和初始属性。
    2.卡可以插入Hashland.com的插槽参与质押挖矿，同时，玩家依然可以使用卡牌参与gameFi中的4种战斗：PVE PVP GVE GVG
    4.玩家可以在PVE中获得少量的HC奖励，获得药水等各种道具。`,
